Processing code to: 1) classify gully presence/absence based on LUCAS survey observations within a scikit-learn workflow, 
and 2) implement the classifier model on raster grids across Europe. 

The standard implementation applies the predict probability function from the random forest classifer to approximate the probability of gully occurance at sites.
